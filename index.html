    <h3>Who and Where</h3>
    <p>I'm from Hilo, Hawaii, which receives over 3x the amount of rainfall as Seattle. So when I tell people I moved here for the weather I'm not lying. It's also the birthplace of the loco moco, which I'm sure is next up on the chopping block to be massacred just like mainland poke. <br /> The last "class" I completed was sometime in 2002, my freshman year of highschool. I never made it past that. Though I sometimes considered giving school another try I never thought I would have the time or reason for it until COVID made it for me.</p>

    <h3>Work</h3>
    <p>After finally dropping out of High School in 2006 I enlisted as a Rifleman in the Marines thinking I would be there forever, until all of a sudden (sometime after joining. I wonder if it's related?) I didn't. After getting out I worked on a film set in San Diego, tug boats in Alaska, private security, sales, line cook, bee keeper, and eventually found Distilling, where I again thought I would remain, but this time I saw how fragile the industry was and how bleak my prospects were long-term in the industry and so I realized the Pandemic lay-off was the exact opportunity I needed for an aggressive career change.</p>
    
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>I want to leave Code Fellows with a strong foundation that I can layer upon with additional homework and experience from an employer in the field. I have very little desire for front-end web development as I think all websites should be simple text documents. I would like to learn Java or Python to crack open a few doors for back-end dev work. Adjusting and adapting to tech culture is also important, though I hope is less important than actual skill.</p>
